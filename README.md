# Clearing House Combine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChristopherDavenport/ClearingHouseCombine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChristopherDavenport/ClearingHouseCombine) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ChristopherDavenport/ClearingHouseCombine/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ChristopherDavenport/ClearingHouseCombine)

While this was a fun experience it turns out that Clearing House will allow

If anyone needs to combine 2 ClearingHouse files really quick
